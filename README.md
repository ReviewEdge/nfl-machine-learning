### Inference Task
Predict whether a given play will be a pass or run
### Method
Decision tree
### Credit
The primary source I referenced was a project by Brandon Donelan, predicting play type for the Cleveland Browns: https://www.kaggle.com/code/gnarlyinsights/nfl-analysis-predicting-play-type \
I used his work as general outline for the process of creating a decision tree with Sklearn.  Additionally, I based my rushing and passing quarterly means synthetic feature off of a similar feature that he created in his project.
